### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

# Frontend Rules ✨

###  Visuals & UX (No ugly UIs)
- Text must be readable. **No white-on-white. Ever.**
- Good contrast, clean spacing, calm layouts.
- Components grow with content — no cramped boxes.
- Subtle motion only (smooth, not flashy).

---

### Safety First
- Passwords, tokens, secrets → **masked inputs by default**.
- Provide show/hide toggles.
- Never log secrets. Never.

---

### Tech Stack
- Use **Next.js** (best with Vercel).
- Must run locally and deploy cleanly to Vercel.
- Always tell users how to run it (`npm install && npm run dev`).

---

### Accessibility (Built-in, not optional)
- Keyboard-friendly UI.
- Visible focus states.
- Labels for inputs (not placeholders only).
- Errors should be obvious and helpful.

---

### Theming (Make it feel intentional)
- Use **theme tokens**, not random hex colors.
- Support **light + dark mode**.
- Default vibe: clean, modern, calm.

**Color mood:**
- Light → soft whites, deep text, confident blue
- Dark → deep slate, gentle contrast, brighter primary

---

### Components (Consistency wins)
- One primary button per screen.
- Clear hover / disabled / error states.
- Cards use elevation + borders (not shadows alone).

---

### Responsive by Default
- Mobile-first mindset.
- Avoid fixed widths.
- Long text should wrap, not break layouts.

---

### Don’ts
- No hardcoded theme colors in components.
- No fixed heights for content containers.
- No secret inputs as plain text.
- No “works on my screen only” UI.

---

### Final Check
If it’s:
- readable ✔
- accessible ✔
- themed ✔
- easy to run ✔

…it’s ready.
